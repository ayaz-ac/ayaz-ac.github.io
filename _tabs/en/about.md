## Hello, I'm Ayaz ðŸ‘‹

I've been passionate about technology for many years and decided to specialize in web development 5 years ago. After mastering the fundamentals of the web (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript), I discovered Ruby on Rails, a framework that immediately captivated me!

For the past 4 years, I've been developing web applications with Ruby on Rails. I strive to maintain high-quality code by adhering to the SOLID principles, following Rails conventions, and implementing thorough testing to ensure stability and security in my projects.

As a naturally curious person, I regularly engage in tech research, both on the web and in the broader tech industry. I enjoy exploring and developing small projects using technologies that complement Ruby on Rails, such as Stimulus.js and Turbo, to expand my skill set and integrate them into my projects.
